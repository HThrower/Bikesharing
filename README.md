# Project Overview
In this analysis, we explore Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool which is more popular in today's professional world. It allows data visualization professionals to create assests that are vitually appealling and easy for a nontechnical audience or stakeholder to understand. We create this visualization so clear and so helpful to give a chance to stakeholders to go directly to the results and make decisions.
