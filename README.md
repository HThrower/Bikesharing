# New York City Citi Bike Analysis

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we explore Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool which is more popular in today's professional world. It allows data visualization professionals to create assists that are virtually appealing and easy for a nontechnical audience or stakeholder to understand. We create this visualization so clear and so helpful to give a chance to stakeholders to go directly to the results and make decisions.

Tableau will help us by

-Providing the tools to create a powerful analytic dashboard
-Tell a clear story
-Can easily share with others In fact, we use three core components like worksheets, dashboard and story to dive in and level up our analysis with the most popular data analytics and visualization too, Tableau.

## Resources
Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

Module: Pandas

## Results

In analyzing the data pertaining to the duration of CitiBike trips, our graphical representation reveals a clear trend: the majority of rides span less than an hour. To delve deeper, a closer inspection indicates that a significant proportion of these trips are completed within half an hour, with a noticeable decline in the frequency of rides exceeding the one-hour mark.Â

Men tend to utilize bicycles for extended durations compared to women, as indicated by the prevalence of blue-colored bikes. In contrast, the usage pattern of red bikes, categorized as unknown or unassigned, remains undetermined.

The busiest periods for our services consistently revolve around two key time frames: 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. During these bustling hours, the platforms experience a surge in user activity, with a diverse range of individuals engaging with our offerings. In the early morning, from 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM, we witness a considerable influx of users seeking information, assistance, and engagement. This period is characterized by a mix of professionals gearing up for their workday, students embarking on their studies, and early risers looking to make the most of their morning routines. Similarly, the evening rush from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM marks another peak in user engagement. As individuals wrap up their work commitments, students conclude their academic responsibilities, and families gather after a day's endeavors, our platforms become a focal point for seeking information, entertainment, and connectivity.

Analysis of trip data based on gender and weekday per hour reveals interesting patterns. Specifically, during the weekdays (Monday to Friday), males exhibit increased activity during two distinct time frames: from 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. This suggests a concentration of male engagement during both morning and evening rush hours.

In contrast, females also display activity during these time frames, mirroring the patterns seen in males. However, the level of female activity is notably less pronounced compared to their male counterparts during the same hours. This indicates a gender-based disparity in the intensity of travel behavior, with males being more actively involved in trips during these particular time slots.

The data underscores the importance of considering both gender and time variables when assessing travel patterns. This nuanced approach provides a deeper understanding of how different demographics engage in trips throughout the day, offering valuable insights for transportation planning and targeted interventions.

A comprehensive analysis of bike usage during a trip, categorized by gender and weekdays, reveals interesting patterns. The predominant users of the bike service are subscribers, with males showing a higher frequency of usage. Specifically, Thursdays and Fridays appear to be the most popular days for male subscribers to utilize the bike-sharing service. Additionally, the trend extends into the beginning of the week, with notable usage on the subsequent Monday and Tuesday.

In contrast, there is a lack of consistency in bike usage among female subscribers, as no specific days stand out prominently. This disparity in usage patterns between genders and weekdays underscores the need for targeted marketing or incentives to encourage a more diverse demographic of users, particularly among female subscribers. This nuanced understanding of user behavior can assist in tailoring strategies to optimize the bike-sharing service's appeal and accessibility across various segments of the population.

## Summary

The data analysis reveals a clear trend in bike usage, indicating that the primary demographic consists of males, particularly during the peak hours of 5 am-9 am and 5 pm-8 pm. This information is valuable for optimizing bike-sharing services during these time frames. However, an untapped potential lies in encouraging more women to utilize bikes, thereby expanding the market reach and promoting inclusivity.

To address this opportunity, conducting further research is essential. This involves delving into the preferences, concerns, and motivations of female potential users. By understanding the specific factors that influence their decision-making regarding bike usage, marketers can tailor their strategies to effectively target and engage this demographic.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to identify the age groups within the female market that might be most receptive to bike-sharing services. This segmentation can help customize marketing campaigns, ensuring they resonate with the preferences and lifestyles of different age brackets. For instance, younger women may be more drawn to the environmental and health benefits, while older women may prioritize convenience and accessibility.

In summary, the key takeaway is to enhance the inclusivity of bike-sharing services by targeting women. This can be achieved through in-depth research to comprehend their unique needs and preferences, as well as by segmenting the female demographic by age to create more targeted and effective marketing strategies. Ultimately, addressing this untapped market can contribute significantly to the overall success and sustainability of bike-sharing initiatives.
