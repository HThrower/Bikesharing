# Project Overview
In this analysis, we explore Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool which is more popular in today's professional world. It allows data visualization professionals to create assests that are vitually appealling and easy for a nontechnical audience or stakeholder to understand. We create this visualization so clear and so helpful to give a chance to stakeholders to go directly to the results and make decisions.

Tableau will help us by

-Providing the tools to create powerful analytic dashboard
-Tell a clear story
-Can easily share with others In fact, we use three core components like worksheets, dashboard and story to dive in and level up our analysis with the most popular data analytic and visualization too, Tableau.

# Summary
[https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyra.hull/viz/CheckoutTimesforUsers_16440726143560/UserTripsbyGenderbyWeekday?publish=yes]

Here we see the summary of usage of bikes for all genders, times that are most used and days of the week that are important. We see that the target market for the bike usage should focus on males around 5a-9am & 5pm-8pm. It would be interesting to find out ways to engage women to use bikes. Maybe running more research to see what ways to market to women and with looking into more the ages we can be able to easier to market correctly to each group.
